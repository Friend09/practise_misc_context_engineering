# Context Engineering Course Documentation

## 📚 Documentation Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for mastering context engineering with a focus on single-agent systems and advanced context management techniques. All content has been updated to reflect 2025 industry best practices, particularly insights from Cognition AI about building reliable, long-running AI agents.

## 🚨 **Critical Updates for 2025**

### **Why Single-Agent Systems?**

Based on industry research from Cognition AI and practical experience, this course has been updated to focus on single-agent systems because:

1. **Context Loss Prevention**: Single-agent systems maintain complete context integrity
2. **Reliability**: No coordination overhead or decision conflicts
3. **Performance**: Superior performance through centralized context management
4. **Simplicity**: Easier to debug, monitor, and maintain

### **Deprecated Patterns**

The following patterns are no longer recommended:
- ❌ Multi-agent coordination with distributed context
- ❌ Context sharing protocols between agents
- ❌ Distributed decision-making systems
- ❌ Agent-to-agent communication patterns

### **Recommended Patterns**

The course now emphasizes:
- ✅ Single-agent orchestration with centralized context
- ✅ Advanced context compression for long-running agents
- ✅ Sequential task execution with full context preservation
- ✅ Hierarchical memory systems for context management
