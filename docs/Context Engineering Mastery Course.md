# Context Engineering Mastery Course

## üö® **Updated for 2025: Single-Agent Architecture Focus**

This course has been updated based on the latest industry insights, particularly from Cognition AI's research showing that **single-agent systems with excellent context engineering outperform multi-agent systems**. The course now focuses on building reliable, single-threaded agents with advanced context management instead of fragile multi-agent architectures.

## üéØ Course Overview

Master the art and science of Context Engineering - the #1 factor for building reliable AI systems. This comprehensive course teaches you to design, implement, and optimize context management systems that power the most sophisticated AI agents in production today.

**Key Update**: Based on 2025 industry best practices, this course emphasizes single-agent architectures with advanced context compression and management, avoiding the context loss and coordination problems inherent in multi-agent systems.

## üö® **Critical Course Updates (2025)**

### **Why Single-Agent Systems?**

Based on industry research and practical experience, multi-agent systems suffer from:
- **Context Loss**: Information doesn't transfer effectively between agents
- **Coordination Overhead**: Management complexity outweighs benefits
- **Decision Conflicts**: Multiple agents make contradictory decisions
- **System Fragility**: Multiple failure points reduce reliability

**Better Approach**: Single-agent systems with excellent context engineering and compression.
