## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture Patterns

### 1. Centralized Context Hub

Single-agent systems use a centralized context hub that manages all information flow:

```python
class ContextHub:
    """Centralized context management for single agents"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_context = {}
        self.context_history = []
        self.optimization_engine = ContextOptimizer()
        self.validation_system = ContextValidator()
        self.monitoring = ContextMonitor()
```

### 2. Context State Machine

Context transitions are managed through well-defined state machines:
- **Initialization** ‚Üí **Active Processing** ‚Üí **Optimization** ‚Üí **Persistence**
- Clear transition rules and validation at each stage
- Rollback capabilities for error recovery

### 3. Adaptive Optimization

Context strategies adapt based on:
- **Performance metrics**: Response time, accuracy, user satisfaction
- **Usage patterns**: Frequent context types, common transitions
- **Resource constraints**: Memory usage, processing time limits
- **User feedback**: Explicit and implicit quality signals

## üî¨ Advanced Techniques

### 1. Context Quality Scoring

Implement sophisticated scoring systems that evaluate:
- **Relevance**: How well context matches current needs
- **Completeness**: Whether all necessary information is present
- **Consistency**: Internal coherence and logical flow
- **Efficiency**: Information density and redundancy levels

### 2. Predictive Context Loading

Use machine learning to predict and preload context:
- **User behavior prediction**: Anticipate likely next requests
- **Context pattern recognition**: Identify recurring context needs
- **Proactive optimization**: Prepare optimal context before needed

### 3. Context Debugging and Introspection

Build tools for understanding and debugging context issues:
- **Context visualization**: Visual representation of context flow
- **Decision tracing**: Track how context influences decisions
- **Performance analysis**: Identify optimization opportunities

## üéØ Performance Targets
