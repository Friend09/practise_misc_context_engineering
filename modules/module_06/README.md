## üìö Module Overview

Modern AI agents require the ability to interact with external systems, execute tools, and integrate real-world data to perform complex tasks. This module teaches you to build sophisticated tool integration systems that extend AI agents beyond their training data, enabling them to take actions and access current information in real-time.

Effective tool integration requires balancing:
- **Context awareness**: Tools should be selected and used based on current context
- **Error resilience**: Robust handling of tool failures and edge cases
- **Performance**: Fast tool execution without blocking agent responses
- **Security**: Safe execution of external tools and API calls
- **Scalability**: Support for hundreds of different tools and services

        self.performance_tracker = ToolPerformanceTracker()
    
    def select_tools(self, task_description, context):
        """Select optimal tools based on task and context"""
        candidates = self.capability_index.find_capable_tools(task_description)
        ranked_tools = self.context_matcher.rank_by_context(candidates, context)
        return self.performance_tracker.filter_by_reliability(ranked_tools)
```
