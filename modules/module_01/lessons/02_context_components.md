**Key Elements**:

- Recent message exchanges (typically last 5-20 turns)
- Conversation flow and logical progression
- Decisions made and rationale provided
- User feedback and corrections
- Contextual references and dependencies

**Implementation Strategy**:

```python
class ShortTermMemory:
    def __init__(self, max_turns=20):
        self.history = []
        self.max_turns = max_turns

    def add_interaction(self, user_input, assistant_response, metadata=None):
        interaction = {
            'timestamp': datetime.now(),
            'user': user_input,
            'assistant': assistant_response,
            'metadata': metadata or {}
        }
        self.history.append(interaction)

        # Maintain sliding window
        if len(self.history) > self.max_turns:
            self.history.pop(0)
```

**Response Processing**:

```python
def process_tool_response(self, tool_name, response):
    """Process and contextualize tool response"""
    processed = {
        'tool': tool_name,
        'timestamp': datetime.now(),
        'success': response.get('error') is None,
        'result': response.get('output'),
        'metadata': {
            'execution_time': response.get('execution_time'),
            'resource_usage': response.get('resource_usage')
        }
    }

    # Add to context for future reference
    self.add_tool_result(processed)

    return processed
```

### 8. Structured Outputs and Formats

**Purpose**: Define expected response structure, format, and validation criteria.

**Key Elements**:

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 9. Global State and Workflow Context

**Purpose**: Track system-wide state, workflow progress, and cross-session context.

**Key Elements**:

- Current workflow stage and progress
- System configuration and settings
- Cross-session state persistence
- Global variables and flags
- Workflow dependencies and relationships

**State Management**:

```python
class GlobalState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.workflow_stage = "initialization"
        self.active_projects = {}
        self.user_preferences = {}
        self.system_config = {}
        self.session_metadata = {}

    def update_workflow_stage(self, new_stage, context=None):
        """Update workflow stage with context preservation"""
        previous_stage = self.workflow_stage
        self.workflow_stage = new_stage

        # Log transition
        self.log_state_transition(previous_stage, new_stage, context)

        # Trigger any necessary state updates
        self.handle_stage_transition(previous_stage, new_stage)
```

## Component Interaction Patterns

### 1. Information Flow

Components don't exist in isolation—they form an interconnected information network:

```
System Instructions → Shape all responses
     ↓
User Input → Triggers context assembly
     ↓
Short-term Memory → Provides immediate context
     ↓
Long-term Memory → Supplies historical insights
     ↓
Knowledge Base → Adds domain expertise
     ↓
Tools → Enable external actions
     ↓
Tool Results → Update context state
     ↓
Structured Output → Formats final response
     ↓
Global State → Maintains system consistency
```

### 2. Context Validation Chain

Each component should validate and enhance the others:

- **System instructions** validate tool usage
- **User input** is checked against **knowledge base**
- **Tool responses** update **global state**
- **Structured outputs** conform to **system guidelines**

### 3. Context Compression Strategy

As context grows, components follow a priority hierarchy:

1. **System instructions** (always preserved)
2. **User input** (current task - highest priority)
3. **Tool responses** (immediate results)
4. **Short-term memory** (recent context)
5. **Global state** (workflow context)
6. **Knowledge base** (compressed summaries)
7. **Long-term memory** (archived insights)
8. **Structured outputs** (format templates)
9. **Tool definitions** (compressed descriptions)

## Best Practices for Component Management

### 1. Component Independence

- Each component should be self-contained and well-defined
- Minimize tight coupling between components
- Enable component updates without breaking others

### 2. Context Validation

- Validate each component before assembly
- Check for consistency across components
- Implement fallback strategies for missing components

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Load components lazily based on need
- Cache frequently accessed components
- Implement efficient component serialization

### 4. Monitoring and Metrics

- Track component usage and performance
- Monitor component interaction patterns
- Measure context assembly time and resource usage

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. Component Bloat

**Problem**: Including unnecessary information in components
**Solution**: Regular pruning and relevance filtering

### 2. Context Conflicts

**Problem**: Components providing contradictory information
**Solution**: Conflict resolution strategies and priority hierarchies

### 3. Stale Context

**Problem**: Components not updating with new information
**Solution**: Automated refresh mechanisms and staleness detection

### 4. Poor Component Boundaries

**Problem**: Mixing different types of information within components
**Solution**: Clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces
