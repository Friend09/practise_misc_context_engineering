## 📚 Module Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a critical component of modern AI systems, enabling them to access and utilize vast knowledge bases dynamically. This module teaches you to build sophisticated RAG systems that integrate seamlessly with context engineering principles, creating AI agents that can access, process, and utilize external knowledge effectively.

## 🏗️ RAG Architecture Patterns

### 1. Context-Enhanced Retrieval Pipeline

```python
class ContextAwareRAG:
    """RAG system with integrated context awareness"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.retriever = ContextualRetriever()
        self.ranker = ContextualRanker()
        self.integrator = KnowledgeIntegrator()
        self.context_manager = RAGContextManager()
```

### 2. Multi-Stage Retrieval

Advanced RAG systems use multi-stage retrieval:
1. **Initial Retrieval**: Broad semantic search across knowledge base
2. **Context Filtering**: Apply context constraints and preferences
3. **Relevance Ranking**: Score based on context and query relevance
4. **Knowledge Integration**: Combine and synthesize retrieved information

### 3. Dynamic Knowledge Sources

Context-aware systems adapt their knowledge sources based on:
- **Query context**: Different sources for different question types
- **User expertise**: Technical vs. general knowledge sources
- **Temporal context**: Recent vs. historical information preferences
- **Domain context**: Specialized knowledge bases for specific domains

## 🔬 Advanced RAG Techniques

### 1. Contextual Query Enhancement

```python
class ContextualQueryEnhancer:
    """Enhance queries with contextual information"""
    def enhance_query(self, query, context):
        # Add context-specific terms
        # Expand with related concepts
        # Apply domain-specific transformations
        return enhanced_query
```

### 2. Semantic Knowledge Graphs

Build knowledge graphs that capture:
- **Entity relationships**: How concepts relate to each other
- **Contextual connections**: Context-dependent relationships
- **Temporal relationships**: How relationships change over time
- **Hierarchical structures**: Concept taxonomies and ontologies

### 3. Adaptive Retrieval Strategies

Implement systems that learn optimal retrieval strategies:
- **Query pattern recognition**: Identify effective retrieval methods
- **Context-strategy mapping**: Learn which strategies work for which contexts
- **Performance feedback loops**: Continuously improve based on results
- **User preference learning**: Adapt to individual user needs
