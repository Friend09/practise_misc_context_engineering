## 🚨 **Why Single-Agent Instead of Multi-Agent?**

### Problems with Multi-Agent Research Systems
```python
# PROBLEMATIC: Multi-agent research coordination
class MultiAgentResearchSystem:  # ❌ Avoid this pattern
    def __init__(self):
        self.researcher_agent = Agent("researcher")
        self.analyst_agent = Agent("analyst")
        self.writer_agent = Agent("writer")
        self.shared_context = {}  # Context fragmentation
    
    def conduct_research(self, query):
        # Context loss between agents
        research_data = self.researcher_agent.research(query, self.shared_context)
        
        # Incomplete context transfer
        analysis = self.analyst_agent.analyze(research_data, self.shared_context)
        
        # Further context degradation
        report = self.writer_agent.write(analysis, self.shared_context)
        
        # Result: fragmented understanding, inconsistent output
        return report
```

### Better Single-Agent Approach
```python
# RECOMMENDED: Single-agent research orchestration
class SingleAgentResearchSystem:  # ✅ Use this pattern
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent = ResearchOrchestrator()
        self.context = UnifiedResearchContext()
    
    def conduct_research(self, query):
        # Single agent with complete context throughout
        return self.agent.orchestrate_research(query, self.context)
